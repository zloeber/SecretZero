# Session Bootstrap

If you haven't already read `AGENTS.md`, read it now — it contains the project identity, non-negotiables, and commands.

Then read this file fully before doing anything else in this session.

## Current Project State
**Working:**
- End-to-end secrets pipeline: `Secretfile.yml` -> `ConfigLoader` -> `SyncEngine` -> targets -> `.gitsecrets.lock`.
- Bundle extensibility for providers/generators/targets via `BundleRegistry` and manifest factories.
- Built-in generators (`random_password`, `random_string`, `static`, `script`, `provider_backed`) and provider-backed targets across AWS/Azure/Vault/GitHub/GitLab/Jenkins/Kubernetes/Infisical.
- Policy/status/drift/terraform command families and comprehensive pytest suite.
- Task-based verification workflow (`lint:fix`, `format`, `schema:update`, `test`, `security:scan`, `test:validations`).

**Not yet built:**
- Autonomous/scheduled secret rotation service (rotation is operator-invoked).
- Browser UI for secret management workflows.
- Fully automated release/deployment orchestration from scaffold itself.

**Known issues:**
- Interpolation mistakes can appear as empty rendered values and require `secretzero render` to diagnose.
- Missing provider extras cause runtime unknown-kind/missing-dependency errors.
- Partial sync can skip if previous value retrieval from existing targets fails.
- Docs/schema/build workflows rely on keeping generated schema in sync.

## Routing Table

Load the relevant file based on the current task. Always load `context/architecture.md` first if not already in context this session.

| Task type | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Understanding how the system works | `context/architecture.md` |
| Working with a specific technology | `context/stack.md` |
| Writing or reviewing code | `context/conventions.md` |
| Making a design decision | `context/decisions.md` |
| Setting up or running the project | `context/setup.md` |
| Adding or modifying secrets in manifests | `patterns/add-secret.md` |
| Editing Secretfile structure/variables/providers | `patterns/secretfile-authoring.md` |
| Adding providers/generators/targets | `patterns/add-bundle.md` |
| Adding CLI commands/options | `patterns/add-cli-command.md` |
| Debugging sync failures | `patterns/debug-sync.md` |
| Any specific task | Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern |

## Behavioural Contract

For every task, follow this loop:

1. **CONTEXT** — Load the relevant context file(s) from the routing table above. Check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a matching pattern. If one exists, follow it. Narrate what you load: "Loading architecture context..."
2. **BUILD** — Do the work. If a pattern exists, follow its Steps. If you are about to deviate from an established pattern, say so before writing any code — state the deviation and why.
3. **VERIFY** — Load `context/conventions.md` and run the Verify Checklist item by item. State each item and whether the output passes. Do not summarise — enumerate explicitly.
4. **DEBUG** — If verification fails or something breaks, check `patterns/INDEX.md` for a debug pattern. Follow it. Fix the issue and re-run VERIFY.
5. **GROW** — After completing the task:
   - If no pattern exists for this task type, create one in `patterns/` using the format in `patterns/README.md`. Add it to `patterns/INDEX.md`. Flag it: "Created `patterns/<name>.md` from this session."
   - If a pattern exists but you deviated from it or discovered a new gotcha, update it with what you learned.
   - If any `context/` file is now out of date because of this work, update it surgically — do not rewrite entire files.
   - Update the "Current Project State" section above if the work was significant.
